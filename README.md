# Real-time Flowchart for VS Code Extension

## 🌟 Overview
The "Real-time Flowchart for VS Code" is an innovative Visual Studio Code extension designed to revolutionize how developers understand and debug complex code logic. It provides an immediate, visual representation of your code's control flow and data flow, transforming intricate `if-else` statements, `switch` cases, and variable lifecycles into intuitive flowcharts right within your IDE.

## ✨ Features (Planned)
- **Real-time Analysis:** Automatically detects and analyzes `if-else`, `switch` statements, and other control flow structures as you type.
- **Dynamic Flowchart Generation:** Visualizes code logic into clear, interactive flowcharts directly in a VS Code panel.
- **Data Flow Visualization:** Tracks and displays the lifecycle of variables, showing how data moves and transforms within your functions.
- **Intuitive Logic Understanding:** Helps developers, especially juniors, quickly grasp complex and nested logic without extensive code reading.
- **Early Bug Detection:** Pinpoints potential logical flaws or "spaghetti code" moments as they are written.
- **(Future) Multi-language Support:** Expand analysis capabilities to other popular programming languages.
